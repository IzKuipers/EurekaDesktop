==================
[ EUREKA DESKTOP ]
==================

An electron wrapper for the Eureka Notes project found at https://github.com/IzKuipers/Eureka-Notes. I wrote this wrapper so that I always have a running instance of Eureka opened on my PC, with the exit confirmation put there so that I don't close it by accident.
